# Using Ansible "Pull" Mode to Dynamically Automate Server/Workstation Builds

## Summary

My work running the Jay LaCroix's  tutorial, [Ansible "Pull" Mode to Dynamically
Automate Server/Workstation Builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn1HQq_GFNE) from
his Youtube channel [LearnLinuxTV](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV) inspired me to
create this repository.

## Goals

[] I wanted to learn how to use Ansible in "pull" mode to
dynamically automate server/workstation builds.

[] I also wanted to learn how to use
Ansible to manage my workstation and server configurations.
